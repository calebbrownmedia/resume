### Summary
I am a multimedia creative from Asheville, North Carolina by way of Guatemala City, Guatemala. I am based in the High Country of North Carolina. 
I am an alumni of the Commercial Photography program at Appalachian State University. I do a little bit of everything, including photography, videography, filmmaking, and post-production.
I am also a fieldworker for SouthArts' In These Mountains Documentary Initiative, which enables me to travel around Central Appalachia documenting contemporary folk arts and life in the region.
